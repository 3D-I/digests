# digests
Digests extension for phpBB 3.1
Please note that when deployed the extension will go under ext/phpbbservices/digests. Only the digests tree is shown here.
If you upgrading from the digests mod for phpBB 3.0, please remove the cron job that you created. You will need to create a new system cron job for phpBB. See https://wiki.phpbb.com/PhpBB3.1/RFC/Modular_cron#Use_system_cron.
